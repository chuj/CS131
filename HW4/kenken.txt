My kenken predicate for KenKen_no_op would take in the same
parameters as regular kenken. Except that the constraints in C
will only include a list of squares within that constraint, but without a specific operation.
What this API would have to do then, would be to not only iterate
through all the numbers in the domain for the squares, but also
to iterate through all the valid operations in each permutation of
the numbers in the squares.
The rest of the goals, such as additions, subtraction, etc. and 
all of the helper goals will remain the same.
