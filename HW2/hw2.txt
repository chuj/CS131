The appraoch I took to solve this problem was inspired by the TA's discussion
and office hours. I found that using or matchers and and matchers lead to 
very good looking logic and code.
The hardest part of this homework assignment was understanding what we were 
supposed to do. To be honest I felt like the specs of this homework assignment
was often vague, and I needed to go to TA discussions and office hours and ask
the TAs to clearly explain what the question was often asking.
My logic to solving the parse_prefix problem is as follows: first you start 
with the start symbol, and you use the or matcher to go through the list of
alternative rules. With each rule you choose, use an and matcher to make sure
that all of the components of that rule has been verified before bubbling the
result back up.
When creating my own grammar, I found that even though the small english grammar
I created made sense in my head, there were still ways to make very awkward 
sounding, albeit correct, english sentences. A weakness of my algorithm is that
it doesn't account for what sounds "right" or "wrong" in english.
